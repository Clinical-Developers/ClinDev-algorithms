# Algorithms and DataStructures Challenge

This week we look at common interview questions that illustrate adequacy in computer programming. Feel free to use any language you would like, however try not to use built-in methods as for several tasks they might not work exactly the way you want them to.

The tasks have been ordered in difficulty, and I hope that you will enjoy the challenge of seeing what level you can achieve! Inspiration has been taken from this [reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/20ahfq/heres_a_pretty_big_list_of_programming_interview/) and this [egghead.io course](https://egghead.io/courses/build-algorithms-using-typescript).
