# Find the repeated item in an array
> Say you have an array that has at least one item repeated. How would you find the repeated item. This is a question commonly presented to beginner developers.

* We start by creating our function which takes an array of type T and return the repeated item T if any.
* Within the function we will throw an error if no item repetition is found

Factors to keep in mind for higher scores:
* Avoid using multiple loops, loop through all the items in the array once.
